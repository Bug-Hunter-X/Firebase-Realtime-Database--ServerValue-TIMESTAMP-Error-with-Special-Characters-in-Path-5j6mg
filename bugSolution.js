The issue stems from using periods in the database path.  Firebase's Realtime Database uses periods as separators in its internal path structure.  Therefore, using a period in a database path can cause unexpected behavior. To resolve this: 
1. Avoid periods in the database path where you're using `ServerValue.TIMESTAMP`.  Use underscores or other valid characters instead.
2. If restructuring the path isn't possible, carefully encode or escape the special characters.  The simplest approach may be to replace the dots in your path with something that's a valid path character.  

Example (bugSolution.js):

```javascript
// Replace the problematic path with one without periods
const databaseRef = firebase.database().ref('users/user_123/timestamp'); 

//Alternatively:  Escape or replace the period if you cannot change path
databaseRef.set({
  timestamp: firebase.database.ServerValue.TIMESTAMP
});
```
